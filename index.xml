      <description>I&#39;m currently a Lead Software Engineer working at Matillion in Manchester (UK) where I lead a strong team of highly skilled engineers with focus on technical excellence and career progression.
Working with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure I architect and lead the engineering effort to build efficient, scaling services and applications.
I&#39;m a passionate engineer who loves programming in languages such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, just to name a few and I believe in writing high quality, maintainable and testable code.</description>
